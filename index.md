# About This Blog
This blog serves a simple purpose: to detail the CTF / security trainings I've completed, and share the (perhaps not-so-pretty) journey to their completion. Just a simple college student learning as much as possible to one day become a pentester; my focus is currently in Web/Network-based testing, but forensics/hardware hacking is a passion of mine as well. 

These write-ups are important to me as a reference moving forward, and hope they will be to fellow learners as well. I spend (perhaps too much) time writing my thought patterns, as I believe stepping into another person's mindset can greatly influence your own understanding of a topic. Keep in mind, that mindset is a growing noob's - consider this as I work!

And remember, ignorance breeds suffering - don't stop learning, and git gud

**Classes are busy now, so content will be sparse for the foreseeable future**
